# Stack Challenge

This challenge requires the dev to implement a stack using an
abstract data type (ADT), in this case set to a char*, to 
fulfill the requirements of program.c 

The framework for a stack implmentation has been created but 
left empty.

program.c has been setup to manipulate a few strings using the
functionality of a stack. A command line message will appear if
any of the functions do not behave as expected.

When the quicksort function has been implmented, compile and
execute the program using the makefile, and check the command
line for success or failure messages.

To setup the challenge:
1. Create a new folder, say 01. (```mkdir 01```)
2. Copy the contents of 00 to 01 (or whichever created in 1.) (```cp 00/* 01/```)
3. Implement the empty function in stack.c
4. Run 'make' in a terminal whilst in the folder created in 1. (```make```)
5. Check for 'Success' message.

Note. If the make file does not compile, check the settings in
makefile are compatible with your compiler. They are currently
setup for gcc with c99 standard.

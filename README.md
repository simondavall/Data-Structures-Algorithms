# Data Structures & Algorithms

Under each of the folders there is an un-implmented data structure or algorithm set up, ready to be implemented.
A readme for each explains what needs to be completed, and how to compile/execute each solution.

These take the form of a series of katas, that once familiar, should not take more than a few mins to complete.

Compiling and running each solution (using 'make') will provide command line feedback whether the implementation
was successful or not.

There is a successful implementation provided for each in the #_solution folder for each data structure or
algorithm. This may not, however, be the best solution :-)
